# tripadvisor_reviews

# Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to analyze the semantics of tripadvisor reviews to determine if a new review was given, what kind of rating it would receive. Some EDA will be performed to see common words within each rating to investigate certain key words that the model may use to evaluate a review. 

# Process
1. Perform EDA on the dataset
    -Create visualizations of the words in a wordcloud
    -Create graphs depicting the frequency of words overall and within each rating category

2. Experiment with several models to determine which one had the best results
    -Naive bayes, random forest, neural networks(utilizing transfer learning)
